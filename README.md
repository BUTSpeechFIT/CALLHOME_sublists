# CALLHOME_sublists

Lists corresponding to the 2000 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (LDC2001S977) dataset, usually referred as “CALLHOME”.

The partition is defined in the Kaldi diarization [recipe](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/dd107fd594ac58af962031c1689abfdc10f84452/egs/callhome_diarization/v2/run.sh). We also list the subsets of recordings per amount of speakers.

Please, refer to this [discussion](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/CALLHOME_sublists/issues/1) for more information about how this split has been used.
